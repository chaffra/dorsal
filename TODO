* Introduce automatic dependency resolution.

* Test Dorsal on the following platforms and correct the package lists
  if necessary.
   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4    (rhel4)   [Broken; very old gcc]
   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5    (rhel5)   [Works without SyFi/VTK/Viper]
   Debian GNU/Linux Unstable       (sid)   [Works!]
   Ubuntu 7.10                   (gutsy)   [Works!]
   Ubuntu 8.04 LTS               (hardy)   [Works!]
   Ubuntu 8.10                (intrepid)   [Works!]
   Mac OS X 10.4 (with Fink)     (tiger)   [Not tested]
   Mac OS X 10.5 (with Fink)   (leopard)   [Works!]
   Windows XP  (with Cygwin)        (xp)   [Being tested]
  Feel free to contribute information for other platforms as well.

* Add (MD5/SHA1) check summing mechanism to the downloading routine
  (and corresponding hashes to the package files) to verify if
  downloaded files are sane.
  Difficulty: Moderate  Urgency: Moderate

* Divide the packages into two sets---rapidly changing (e.g. the
  FEniCS projects) and slow changing (e.g. Python,
  Mercurial). Introduce the notion of a "first build" to bootstrap the
  system and subsequent "refresh" builds to update only the rapidly
  changing packages.

* Introduce support for Windows (with Cygwin/MinGW).
  Difficulty: High      Urgency: Moderate

* Add scons as a build type, since more FEniCS projects are migrating
  to it.
  Difficulty: Low       Urgency: Moderate

* Add a post-build step to the build chain to allow for any special
  cleanup steps or messages that need to be passed on to the user.
