* Introduce automatic dependency resolution.
  Difficulty: High      Urgency: Low

* Test Dorsal on the following platforms and correct the package lists
  if necessary.
   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4    (rhel4)   [Broken; very old gcc]
   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5    (rhel5)   [Works without CMake/VTK/Viper]
   Debian Etch                    (etch)   [Not tested]

* Add (MD5/SHA1) check summing mechanism to the downloading routine
  (and corresponding hashes to the package files) to verify if
  downloaded files are sane.
  Difficulty: Moderate  Urgency: Moderate

* Divide the packages into two sets---rapidly changing (e.g. the
  FEniCS projects) and slow changing (e.g. Python,
  Mercurial). Introduce the notion of a "first build" to bootstrap the
  system and subsequent "refresh" builds to update only the rapidly
  changing packages.
  Difficulty: Moderate  Urgency: Moderate

* Allow the user to specify whether she wants to install development
  versions of FEniCS projects or only build point-release tarballs.
  Difficulty: Easy      Urgency: High

* Allow the user to install just a single package by specifying
  something like ./dorsal.sh package-install foo
  Difficulty: Easy      Urgency: High

* Sniff out 32/64 bit-ness of machines automatically to suitably set
  GMP_ARCH, SCOTCH_ARCH etc.
