This directory tree holds version 0.2 of Dorsal, a set of simple
scripts to build Dolfin and the rest of the FEniCS entourage (as well
as their dependencies) for various platforms.

In order to use Dorsal, first make sure your platform is supported by
looking for it under the 'platforms' directory. (If it's not, please
let us know about it and we will work toward adding it.) Then, invoke
the build script by running:

  ./dorsal.sh platforms/foo.platform

where 'foo' is your platform. If all goes according to plan, you
should see a lot of compilation-related text scroll past your screen
and eventually end up with a complete, up-to-date installation of
various FEniCS projects and their corresponding dependencies.

If you run into any problems, ensure that you've installed all the
preliminary dependencies for your platform (usually from the system
package manager) that Dorsal assumes you already have. An incomplete
list of this is provided in the .platform file for each platform. In
most cases, this should solve your problem. If you're having further
difficulty, please contact us.
