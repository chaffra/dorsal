This branch of dorsal has been enhanced to support multiple projects
and out-of-source builds.

In comparison to the main branch the changes consists of:

1. The setup for each project (i.e. the directories platforms and packages)
   now resides in separate directories named after project, e.g. FEniCS,
   FEMDK and so on.
2. The user chooses the project by setting the variable PROJECT in dorsal.cfg
   If not set the default values is FEniCS
3. There is support to configure and compile AutoTools driven packages 
   in a separate directory. In dorsal.cfg there is BUILD_PATH variable
   that specifies where is the top build directory. If package variable
   CLEANBUILD is set to 'yes' then it will be built in a appropriate
   subdirectory of BUILD_PATH. If not set the default value for CLEANBUILD
   is 'no'.
