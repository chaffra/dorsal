# Dorsal

This directory tree holds Dorsal, a set of simple scripts to build
components of the FEniCS Project (as well as their dependencies) for
various platforms. Currently, Dorsal supports the following
environments:

* Fedora 13, 14, 15
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, 10.10, 11.04, 11.10
* openSUSE 11.3, 11.4, 12.1
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
* Debian GNU/Linux 6.0, Unstable
* Mac OS X 10.6, 10.7 (with MacPorts)

If your favourite platform is not on the list above, let us know about
it, and we can work together toward adding it.

Please refer to the file USAGE for details on compiling and installing
the FEniCS Project with the help of Dorsal. USAGE demonstrates how
Dorsal comes in handy under common usage scenarios. The file also
provides a brief overview of the underlying structure of Dorsal, so
you may want to go through it if you are interested in extending
Dorsal to suit your needs.

If you run into any problems, ensure that you've installed all the
preliminary dependencies for your platform (usually from the system
package manager) that Dorsal assumes you already have. An incomplete
list of this is provided in the .platform file for each platform,
along with platform-specific tips. In most cases, these should solve
your problem. If you're having further difficulty, please go through
the file USAGE for detailed usage and troubleshooting instructions, or
contact us by e-mailing dorsal@lists.launchpad.net. Before writing to
this mailing list, you will need to become a participant at
