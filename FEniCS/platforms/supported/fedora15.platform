# Fedora 15

# This build script assumes that you have several packages already
# installed via Fedora's yum using the following command:
#
# su -c 'yum install -y redhat-lsb bzr bzrtools subversion \
# libxml2-devel gcc gcc-c++ openmpi-devel openmpi numpy swig wget \
# vtk-python atlas-devel suitesparse-devel blas-devel \
# lapack-devel cln-devel ginac-devel python-devel cmake \
# ScientificPython mpfr-devel armadillo-devel gmp-devel CGAL-devel \
# cppunit-devel flex bison bzip2-devel python-ply'
#
# If you have multiple MPI libraries installed, make sure the
# appropriate version is selected. For this, on a 32-bit operating
# system, run:
#
# module load openmpi-i386
#
# or on a 64-bit operating system, run:
#
# module load openmpi-x86_64
#
# After Dorsal has completed, please make sure the following
# environment variable is set before running any Python DOLFIN
# programs:
#
# export BOOST_DIR=${INSTALL_PATH}
#
# Also, if you are using SELinux, you may need to disable it to run
# DOLFIN programs.
